## Thoughts

There are still some problems with the CSS with wrapping, but I mostly wanted to focus on the JS anyways.

You can play yourself, even added a reload button.

Had some trouble running a check for early automatic wins, such as if it is round 4, and the computer has a score of 2, there would be no way for the player to win, resulting in an automatic win for the computer. Just added it to the round function, and worked out fine.
